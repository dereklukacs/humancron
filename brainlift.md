## Purpose

Increase my personal productivity. I want to flow through a set batch of tasks efficiently wihtout geting distracted.


## Experts
- Mihály Csíkszentmihályi	Coined flow in the 1970s, mapped its nine defining dimensions, and showed that “optimal experience” is key to lasting happiness.
- Jeanne Nakamura	Long-time collaborator who refined experience-sampling methods and still publishes on flow across adulthood and the arts.
- Susan A. Jackson	Brought flow into sport & exercise science (Flow in Sports, 1999; Experiencing Flow, 2024). Developed the Flow State Scale used in research and coaching.

- Cal Newport (Deep Work)	Uses “task blocks” inside a time-blocked calendar: small admin items are corralled into a single block so they don’t fragment deep-work sessions.

- Merlin Mann (Inbox Zero)	Pioneered the idea of batch email processing (delete, delegate, defer, do) to keep the inbox from dictating the day.
- Chris Bailey (How to Train Your Mind, The Productivity Project)	Promotes “rolling time blocks,” flexibly slotting chunks of similar tasks into the day so you keep momentum without rigid scheduling.

- Stephen Guise’s “Mini Habits” Guise’s one-push-up challenge showed that ridiculously small commitments bypass willpower depletion and still spark meaningful change.

## Spiky POV
1. A lot of knowledge worker tasks are recurring and repetitive.
2. **Spiky** A lot of the value of these tasks are not in getting them done, but in the *doing*
3. Getting through these things is best done in a batched manner
4. Going through these chores is a great way of building momentum
5. One of the goals is to quickly go and gather information from the source in order to load the context into the users mental RAM.
6. The biggest challenge to going through these steps is staying on task
