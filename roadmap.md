Core functionality:
- [ ] yml file to todo list with actions
- [ ] sys tray
- [ ] hotkeys and omnipresence



Tech debt:
- should we use a yml parsing library?


Bugs:
- [x] no hover effect on selection
- [ ] systray show current step title
- [ ] should close when clicking behind "modal"
- [ ] clear area at the bottom of the main window
- [ ] remove 1-9 hotkeys
- [ ] the first enter key press should open the link, second enter key press then completes the task. Â 

New features: 
- minimal mode (hide hotkeys)

Generic feedback:
- Onboarding design is bad
- Settings design is bad
- styling and spacing of current task view
- systray icon is bad
- cool background
